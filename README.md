This project is a demonstration of using JavaScript for DOM Manipulation.  The page is a simple dice game called "Pig".  Details on the rules can be found on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)).  To play, just download the repo and open up the index.html file.  The game will start itself once the page loads.
